This is when your program crashes. That is, the interpreter terminates the execution of your program and displays an error message on the screen.\n","\n","But those big red errors don’t look quite good on the screen, right?\n","\n","To avoid that, Python allows us to handle these exceptions in our own way so that our program doesn’t terminate abruptly.\n","\n","# **Catching Exceptions in Python**\n","Python raises an exception when a run-time error occurs. If your program doesn’t have code to take care of a raised exception, we say that the exception is uncaught. In that case, the interpreter will terminate your code and then display an error message.\n","\n","That said, we can also catch a raised exception. But catching an exception is not enough, we also have to decide what to do next. That is, we need to provide an alternate flow of execution. You can either run some other code in place of the crashed code. Or you can display a clean error message and terminate your application.\n","\n","This is the magic of Exception Handling, you can choose what happens when an exception
